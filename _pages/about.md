I am a Postdoctroal Research Fellow at the [Austraian Institute for Machine Learning](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/aiml/), the University of Adelaide, collaborated with Prof Javen Shi and Prof Shizhang Qiao. I work in the interdisciplinary area of **machine learning** and **computational chemistry**, and have gained valuable experience in utilizing them for the purpose of **renewable-energy materials discovery** and **drug discovery**.

Before joining this position, I completed my PhD in Computer Science from [the University of Newcastle, Australia](https://www.newcastle.edu.au). During my doctoral studies, I had the privilege of being supervised by Prof Alister Page and A/Prof Raymond Chiong. Prior to that, I completed my Master's degree in Renewable Energy at [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](http://english.hust.edu.cn), under the guidance of Prof Jian Li and Prof Lichao Jia. I also gained valuable industry experience as an algorithm intern at [Galixir Technology](https://www.galixir.com/en/about).

In my spare time, I enjoy playing with my son and doing outdoor activities with fridends.
